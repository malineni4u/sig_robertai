## Usage

1. Use **Smart Issue Explorer** to describe symptoms or paste incident text.
2. Use **Incident Investigator** to explore a specific incident ID.
3. Use **TraceIQ** to explore logs by trace ID.
4. Use **NetViz Explorer** to explore visual relationships between services and CIs.
5. Use the built-in chatbot for self-help queries.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure OpenAI API key is correctly set.
- For Hugging Face models, ensure you have internet access or install models locally.
- If logs fail to load, verify log injection API is connected.

## LLM & Intelligence Stack

- üî° **Embedding**: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` via SentenceTransformers
- üîç **Vector DB**: FAISS with **Gaussian Distance**  
  ```
  S(x, y) = exp(-‚Äñx - y‚Äñ¬≤ / (2 * œÉ¬≤))
  ```
- üß† **LLMs**:
  - OpenAI GPT-3.5 (Primary)
  - Mistral 7B (Hugging Face fallback)
  - `LaMini-Flan-T5-783M` (lightweight fallback)
