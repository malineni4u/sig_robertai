## 🖥️ User-Interface Overview

![Sigma-AI UI Preview](docs/sigma_ui_preview.jpg)

- 🧠 **Smart Issue Explorer**  
  Convert any natural language issue into vector embeddings and search similar incidents. Get RCA and related CRs powered by LLMs. 
    - Converts it into vector embeddings
    - Uses FAISS with Gaussian Distance to find similar past incidents
    - Uses GenAI (LLMs) to provide:
      - Contextual incident matches
      - Relevant RCA suggestions
      - Correlated CRs (Change Requests) based on CI and timing
      - Helpful resolution summaries 
  
- 🧾 **Incident Investigator**  
  Enter a specific incident ID to generate contextual RCA, show related CRs, and suggest resolution.  
    - Retrieves historical matches
    - Applies LLM to generate a **Root Cause Analysis (RCA)**
    - Suggests probable causes and next steps
  
- 🧬 **TraceIQ**  
  Feed logs from APIs, analyze them using LLMs, and receive suggestions based on trace ID and log content.  
    - Reads logs from connected log injection APIs
    - Applies LLM to suggest possible fixes
    - Helps platform teams derive meaning from complex logs

- 🌐 **NetViz Explorer**  
  Visualize app-to-CI/API dependencies using CMDB mapping and explore how components are connected.  
    - Builds a **dynamic network diagram** from CMDB data
    - Displays app-to-CI/API relationships
    - Helps teams understand dependency paths and potential breakpoints
  
- 💬 **Agentic Chatbot**  
  Ask questions, explore suggestions, and receive guidance directly through an LLM-powered assistant.
  - Self-help for generalized platform queries
  - Guidance on Sigma-AI usage
  - Fast answers to system and RCA-related questions
  - Direct interaction with knowledge embedded from your incidents, CRs, and CMDB

## 🔁 Power of Two Models – Smart Fallback

Sigma-AI intelligently uses:
- ⚡ **Primary**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 for RCA generation
- 🔄 **Fallback**: Hugging Face Mistral 7B when OpenAI quota limits apply

## 📐 Incident Similarity Search with L2 (Euclidean) Distance

Sigma-AI uses **FAISS** for high-performance similarity search based on **squared Euclidean (L2) distance**. This is used to compare vector embeddings and retrieve semantically similar incidents.

### 📏 L2 (Euclidean) Distance

The standard Euclidean distance between two vectors **x** and **y** is:

<div align="center">

$$
\\text{distance} = \\sqrt{(x_1 - y_1)^2 + (x_2 - y_2)^2 + \\cdots + (x_n - y_n)^2}
$$
